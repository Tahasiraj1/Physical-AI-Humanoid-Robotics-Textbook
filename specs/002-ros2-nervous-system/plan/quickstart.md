### Step 3: Write ROS 2 Fundamentals Section

**File**: `ros2-fundamentals.md`

**Content to Include**:
- What ROS 2 is and its purpose
- Core concepts: nodes, topics, services, actions (FR-002)
- Python code examples for each concept (FR-007)
- Definitions of key terminology (FR-013)

**Checklist**:
- [ ] All core concepts explained
- [ ] Python code examples included
- [ ] Key terms defined
- [ ] Concepts build logically (FR-006)

### Step 4: Write Communication Patterns Section

**File**: `communication-patterns.md`

**Content to Include**:
- Publish-subscribe pattern (topics) (FR-003)
- Request-response pattern (services) (FR-003)
- Action-based pattern (FR-003)
- When to use each pattern
- Python code examples

**Checklist**:
- [ ] All three patterns explained
- [ ] Use cases clarified
- [ ] Code examples demonstrate patterns
- [ ] Visual aids included (diagrams)

### Step 5: Write Humanoid Robotics Applications Section

**File**: `humanoid-applications.md`

**Content to Include**:
- ROS 2 in sensor integration scenarios (FR-004)
- ROS 2 in actuator coordination (FR-004)
- ROS 2 in locomotion control (FR-004)
- Mapping ROS 2 components to robot subsystems
- Concrete examples with humanoid robot context

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Applications clearly connected to ROS 2 concepts
- [ ] Humanoid robotics context throughout
- [ ] Examples illustrate practical value
- [ ] Visual aids showing integration

### Step 6: Write Workspace Overview Section

**File**: `workspace-overview.md`

**Content to Include**:
- Brief overview of ROS 2 workspace structure
- Basic concepts (workspace, package, build)
- No detailed installation steps
- Conceptual understanding focus

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Overview is brief (not detailed tutorial)
- [ ] Concepts explained clearly
- [ ] No installation instructions
- [ ] Sets context for future modules

### Step 7: Add Navigation and Cross-References

**Tasks**:
- Create table of contents (auto-generated by Docusaurus)
- Add cross-references between sections (FR-008)
- Add forward references to future modules (if needed)
- Verify 3-click navigation (SC-008)

**Checklist**:
- [ ] All sections linked in navigation
- [ ] Cross-references accurate
- [ ] Forward references clearly marked
- [ ] Navigation depth ≤ 3 clicks

### Step 8: Add Visual Aids

**Tasks**:
- Create Mermaid diagrams for architecture
- Create diagrams for communication patterns
- Add illustrations for complex concepts (FR-012, SC-010)
- Ensure all visuals have captions

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Architecture diagram included
- [ ] Communication pattern diagrams included
- [ ] Complex concepts have visual aids
- [ ] All visuals have descriptive captions

### Step 9: Review and Quality Assurance

**Review Checklist**:
- [ ] All functional requirements met (FR-001 through FR-015)
- [ ] All success criteria measurable (SC-001 through SC-010)
- [ ] Content readable in 1-2 hours (SC-001)
- [ ] Python code examples valid and focused
- [ ] Terminology consistent (SC-009)
- [ ] Learning objectives addressed
- [ ] Content supports embedding (FR-011)

### Step 10: Embedding Preparation

**Tasks**:
- Verify content structure supports chunking
- Ensure section boundaries align with semantic breaks
- Add metadata tags to frontmatter
- Test chunking strategy with sample content

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Content chunkable at section level
- [ ] Metadata tags complete
- [ ] Chunk boundaries preserve meaning
- [ ] Ready for embedding pipeline

## Content Writing Tips

### Writing Style
- Use clear, accessible language (FR-009)
- Write for students with Python knowledge but no ROS 2 expertise
- Use active voice where possible
- Keep sentences concise (15-20 words average)

### Concept Explanation
- Define before use
- Use analogies (nervous system analogy)
- Provide examples immediately after explanation
- Connect to humanoid robotics context

### Code Examples
- Keep examples minimal but complete
- Focus on single concept per example
- Use humanoid robotics scenarios
- Include brief comments explaining key points

### Visual Aids
- Use diagrams for architecture and patterns
- Use illustrations for complex concepts
- Ensure visuals enhance, not replace, text
- Include descriptive captions

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Too Technical**: Don't assume ROS 2 expertise
2. **Too Shallow**: Ensure concepts are explained thoroughly
3. **Missing Context**: Always connect to humanoid robotics
4. **Inconsistent Terminology**: Use defined terms consistently
5. **Poor Navigation**: Ensure all sections easily accessible
6. **Incomplete Examples**: Code examples must be clear and focused
7. **Missing Visuals**: Complex concepts need visual aids

## Next Steps After Content Creation

1. **Content Review**: Review against requirements checklist
2. **Embedding Test**: Test content chunking and embedding
3. **RAG Testing**: Verify RAG chatkit can retrieve accurate information
4. **Navigation Test**: Verify 3-click navigation requirement
5. **Reading Time Validation**: Confirm 1-2 hour reading time
6. **Integration**: Integrate with Docusaurus site structure
7. **Deployment**: Deploy to GitHub Pages
