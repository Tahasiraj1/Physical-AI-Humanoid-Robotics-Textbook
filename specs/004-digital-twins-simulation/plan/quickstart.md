## Content Writing Tips

### Writing Style
- Use clear, accessible language
- Write for students with Module 1 knowledge but no digital twin/simulation expertise
- Use active voice where possible
- Keep sentences concise (15-20 words average)

### Concept Explanation
- Define before use
- Use analogies (digital twin as "virtual replica")
- Provide examples immediately after explanation
- Connect to humanoid robotics context
- Distinguish digital twins from traditional simulations clearly

### Code Examples
- Keep examples minimal but complete
- Focus on single concept per example
- Use humanoid robotics scenarios
- Include brief comments explaining key points
- Use ROS 2 Python API (rclpy) for sensor integration examples

### Visual Aids
- Use Mermaid diagrams for architecture and data flow
- Use diagrams for complex concepts
- Ensure visuals enhance, not replace, text
- Include descriptive captions
- Connect visuals to concepts being taught

### Cross-References
- Reference Module 1 when discussing ROS 2 concepts
- Use clear link text (e.g., "As discussed in Module 1's [topics section](../module-1-ros2-nervous-system/communication-patterns.md#topics)")
- Provide context for why reference is relevant

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Too Technical**: Don't assume digital twin/simulation expertise
2. **Too Shallow**: Ensure concepts are explained thoroughly
3. **Missing Context**: Always connect to humanoid robotics
4. **Inconsistent Terminology**: Use defined terms consistently
5. **Poor Navigation**: Ensure all sections easily accessible
6. **Incomplete Examples**: Code examples must be clear and focused
7. **Missing Visuals**: Complex concepts need visual aids (FR-017)
8. **Weak Module 1 Connection**: Don't assume students remember all Module 1 details
9. **Unclear Distinction**: Make digital twin vs simulation distinction very clear
10. **Missing Sensor Types**: Must cover at least 3 sensor types (SC-002)

## Next Steps After Content Creation

1. **Content Review**: Review against requirements checklist
2. **Embedding Test**: Test content chunking and embedding
3. **RAG Testing**: Verify RAG chatkit can retrieve accurate information
4. **Navigation Test**: Verify 3-click navigation requirement (SC-006)
5. **Reading Time Validation**: Confirm 1-2 hour reading time
6. **Cross-Reference Validation**: Verify all Module 1 references work
7. **Integration**: Integrate with Docusaurus site structure
8. **Deployment**: Deploy to GitHub Pages
