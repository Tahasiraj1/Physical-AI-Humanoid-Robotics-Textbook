# Welcome to the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This textbook provides in-depth coverage of the fundamental concepts, technologies, and applications needed to understand and work with humanoid robotic systems.

## About This Textbook

This textbook is designed for students, researchers, and practitioners who want to learn about:

- **Physical AI** - The intersection of artificial intelligence and physical robotic systems
- **Humanoid Robotics** - The design, control, and operation of human-like robots
- **ROS 2** - The Robot Operating System 2, the communication framework for robotics
- **Practical Applications** - Real-world scenarios and implementations

## Textbook Structure

The textbook is organized into **modules**, each covering a distinct topic:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Learn about ROS 2 as the communication framework that enables robotic systems to function. This module covers:

- ROS 2 fundamentals and core concepts
- Communication patterns (topics, services, actions)
- Applications in humanoid robotics
- Workspace structure and organization

[Start with Module 1 →](/modules/module-1-ros2-nervous-system/)

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you should have:

- **Python programming knowledge** - Comfortable with Python syntax and basic programming concepts
