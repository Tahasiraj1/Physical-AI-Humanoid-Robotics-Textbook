# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Textbook. This module introduces ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) as the "nervous system" that enables communication and coordination in robotic systems.

## Overview

Just as the human nervous system coordinates the body's functions through electrical signals, ROS 2 serves as the communication framework that allows different components of a robot to work together seamlessly. This module will help you understand:

- What ROS 2 is and why it's essential for humanoid robotics
- Core ROS 2 concepts: nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Communication patterns that enable distributed robotic systems
- How ROS 2 applies to humanoid robot applications

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Explain ROS 2's role** in robotics as a communication and coordination framework
2. **Identify appropriate communication patterns** (topics, services, actions) for different robotic scenarios
3. **Map ROS 2 components** to humanoid robot subsystems and understand their practical applications

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- **Python programming knowledge** - You should be comfortable with Python syntax, functions, classes, and basic programming concepts
- **Basic robotics concepts** - Understanding of what robots are, basic components like sensors and actuators

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following sections:

1. **[Introduction](./introduction.md)** - ROS 2 as the robotic nervous system
2. **[ROS 2 Fundamentals](./ros2-fundamentals.md)** - Core concepts and components
3. **[Communication Patterns](./communication-patterns.md)** - How robot components communicate
4. **[Humanoid Robotics Applications](./humanoid-applications.md)** - ROS 2 in practice
5. **[Workspace Overview](./workspace-overview.md)** - Understanding ROS 2 workspace structure

## Estimated Reading Time

This module is designed to be completed in **1-2 hours** for an average reader.

## Next Steps

Begin with the [Introduction](./introduction.md) to understand the nervous system analogy and ROS 2's fundamental purpose.
