# Module 2: Digital Twins - Simulation & Sensors

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Textbook. This module explores how digital twins, simulation environments, and sensors work together to enable safe, efficient development of humanoid robots.

## Overview

Modern humanoid robotics development relies on virtual representations of physical systems to test, optimize, and validate robot behavior before deployment. This module will help you understand:

- What digital twins are and how they differ from traditional simulations
- How simulation environments model physics, sensors, and environments
- How different types of sensors integrate with ROS 2 to provide robot perception
- Practical applications of digital twins in humanoid robotics development

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Explain digital twins** and their relationship to physical robots, distinguishing them from traditional simulations
2. **Identify key components** of simulation environments (physics engines, sensor models, environments) and explain how they enable safe testing
3. **Describe sensor integration** with ROS 2, including how different sensor types (vision, proprioception, tactile) provide data for robot perception and decision-making
4. **Apply digital twin concepts** to humanoid robotics use cases such as gait optimization, manipulation planning, and safety testing
5. **Navigate Module 2 content** and use cross-references to Module 1 for ROS 2 context

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- **Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)** - Understanding of ROS 2 concepts including nodes, topics, services, and actions
- **Python programming knowledge** - Comfortable with Python syntax, functions, classes, and basic programming concepts
- **Basic robotics concepts** - Understanding of what robots are, basic components like sensors and actuators
