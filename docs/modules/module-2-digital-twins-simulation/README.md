- Comprehensive tutorials on specific simulation platforms
- Hands-on coding tutorials requiring local setup
- Detailed sensor hardware specifications and datasheets
- Advanced simulation techniques (machine learning in simulation, etc.)
- Real-time sensor fusion algorithms (covered in later modules)
- Detailed ROS 2 setup and installation (covered in Module 1 overview)
