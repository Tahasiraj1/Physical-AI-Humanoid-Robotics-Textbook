## RESPONSE_TEXT

Generated comprehensive implementation tasks for GitHub Pages Deployment feature. Created tasks.md with 64 tasks organized by user story priorities:

**Task Organization**:
- Phase 1: Setup (5 tasks) - Initialize deployment infrastructure and verify prerequisites
- Phase 2: Foundational (7 tasks) - Establish deployment foundation and verify build process
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - Access Textbook via GitHub Pages (19 tasks) - P1, MVP scope
- Phase 4: User Story 2 - Automatic Deployment on Content Updates (12 tasks) - P1
- Phase 5: User Story 3 - Reliable Site Availability (10 tasks) - P2
- Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (11 tasks) - Finalization and documentation

**Key Features**:
- All tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- Tasks organized by user story for independent implementation
- MVP scope defined (User Story 1: 19 tasks for initial deployment)
- Dependencies and story completion order documented (US1 blocks US2, US3)
- Each user story phase independently testable
- GitHub Actions workflow configuration tasks included
- Deployment reliability and error handling tasks covered

**Implementation Strategy**:
- MVP: User Story 1 (Access Textbook via GitHub Pages) delivers core value
- User Story 2 (Automatic Deployment) should follow immediately to meet constitution requirements
- User Story 3 (Reliability) enhances system but doesn't block initial deployment

Tasks ready for immediate execution with clear file paths, GitHub Actions workflow setup, and comprehensive deployment coverage.
