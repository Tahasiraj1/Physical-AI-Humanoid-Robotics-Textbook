## RESPONSE_TEXT

Started implementation of Module 2: Digital Twins - Simulation & Sensors content. Progress summary:

**Phase 1: Setup (COMPLETED)**
- ✅ T001-T005: Created module directory structure, assets directory, index.md with overview/learning objectives, updated sidebar configuration, verified build

**Phase 2: Foundational (COMPLETED)**
- ✅ T006-T010: Established content structure standards, verified frontmatter schema, created glossary structure, established Python code format standards, created Mermaid diagram templates

**Phase 3: User Story 1 - Digital Twins (COMPLETED)**
- ✅ T011-T013: Wrote introduction section with learning objectives and prerequisites
- ✅ T014-T016: Wrote comprehensive digital twins section covering FR-001, FR-002, FR-003 (what digital twins are, distinction from simulations, value for humanoid robotics)
- ✅ T017-T018: Created and embedded digital twin architecture Mermaid diagram
- ✅ T019: Added glossary entries for digital twin, virtual replica, synchronization
- ✅ T020: Ensured progressive disclosure in digital-twins.md

**Content Created**:
- `index.md` - Module landing page with overview and learning objectives
- `introduction.md` - Comprehensive introduction to digital twins, simulation, and sensors
- `digital-twins.md` - Full section on digital twins concept, distinction from simulations, value proposition, architecture, and applications
- `glossary.md` - Initial glossary entries
- `_assets/digital-twin-architecture.mmd` - Mermaid diagram for digital twin architecture
- Updated `sidebars.ts` with Module 2 navigation

**Build Status**: ✅ Docusaurus build successful (warnings about broken anchors expected for placeholder sections)

**Next Steps**: Continue with Phase 4 (Simulation Fundamentals) - T021-T030
