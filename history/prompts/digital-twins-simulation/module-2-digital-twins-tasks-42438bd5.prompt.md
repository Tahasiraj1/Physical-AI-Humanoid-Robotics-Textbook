Generated comprehensive implementation tasks for Module 2: Digital Twins - Simulation & Sensors content authoring. Created tasks.md with 72 tasks organized by user story priorities:

**Task Organization**:
- Phase 1: Setup (5 tasks) - Module structure and Docusaurus integration
- Phase 2: Foundational (5 tasks) - Content structure standards and templates
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - Understand Digital Twins Concept (10 tasks) - P1, MVP scope
- Phase 4: User Story 2 - Learn Simulation Fundamentals (10 tasks) - P1
- Phase 5: User Story 3 - Understand Sensor Integration (12 tasks) - P1
- Phase 6: User Story 4 - Apply Digital Twins to Humanoid Robotics (9 tasks) - P2
- Phase 7: User Story 5 - Navigate and Reference (7 tasks) - P2
- Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (14 tasks) - Finalization and validation

**Key Features**:
- All tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- Tasks organized by user story for independent implementation
- Parallel opportunities identified (visual aids, code examples, glossary entries)
- MVP scope defined (User Story 1: 10 tasks for digital twins foundation)
- Dependencies and story completion order documented (US1 blocks US2-4)
- Each user story phase independently testable
- All required sections covered: introduction, digital-twins, simulation-fundamentals, sensor-integration, humanoid-applications, simulation-to-deployment, glossary

**Implementation Strategy**:
- MVP: User Story 1 (Understand Digital Twins Concept) delivers core educational value
- User Stories 2 and 3 (Simulation and Sensors) are also P1 and should follow immediately
- User Stories 4 and 5 (Applications and Navigation) are P2 and enhance the module
- Logical progression: Digital Twins → Simulation → Sensors → Applications

**Content Coverage**:
- Digital twins concept and distinction from simulations
- Simulation fundamentals (physics engines, sensor simulation, environment modeling)
- Sensor integration (vision, proprioception, tactile) with ROS 2
- Humanoid robotics applications (gait optimization, manipulation planning, safety testing)
- Simulation-to-deployment workflow
- Comprehensive glossary and cross-references to Module 1

Tasks ready for immediate execution with clear file paths, dependencies, and comprehensive coverage of all functional requirements.
