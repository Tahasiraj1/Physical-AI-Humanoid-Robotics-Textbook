/sp.analyze Is Module 2: Digital Twins - Simulation & Sensors completed, and ready to push on github pages?
```

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Performed completion readiness analysis for Module 2 deployment to GitHub Pages.

**Status**: ❌ **NOT READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

**Completion Metrics**:
- Task Completion: 20/73 tasks (27%)
- Content Coverage: 3/8 sections complete (37.5%)
- Requirements Coverage: 4/17 functional requirements (23.5%)
- Success Criteria: 1/10 complete (10%), 3/10 partial (30%)

**Completed Phases**:
- ✅ Phase 1: Setup (5/5)
- ✅ Phase 2: Foundational (5/5)
- ✅ Phase 3: User Story 1 - Digital Twins (10/10)

**Missing Critical Content**:
- ❌ Phase 4: Simulation Fundamentals (0/10) - simulation-fundamentals.md is placeholder
- ❌ Phase 5: Sensor Integration (0/12) - sensor-integration.md is placeholder
- ❌ Phase 6: Humanoid Applications (0/9) - humanoid-applications.md and simulation-to-deployment.md are placeholders
- ❌ Phase 7: Navigation & References (0/7)
- ❌ Phase 8: Polish & Validation (0/14)

**Critical Gaps**:
1. Missing core content: Simulation, Sensors, Applications sections
2. Missing Python code examples (FR-011, FR-012)
3. Missing 2/3 visual aids (sensor data flow, simulation components diagrams)
4. Incomplete glossary (only digital twin terms)
5. Missing cross-references to Module 1 (FR-015)

**Build Status**: ✅ Docusaurus builds successfully, but content is incomplete.

**Recommendation**: Do not deploy to GitHub Pages. Complete Phases 4-6 (core content) as minimum viable deployment, then complete Phases 7-8 for full readiness.

**Remaining Work**: 53 tasks (73% of total) need completion before deployment.
