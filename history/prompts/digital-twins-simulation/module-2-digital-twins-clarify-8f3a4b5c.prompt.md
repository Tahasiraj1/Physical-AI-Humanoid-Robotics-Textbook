## RESPONSE_TEXT

Performed ambiguity scan on Module 2: Digital Twins - Simulation & Sensors specification. Analyzed all taxonomy categories:

**Coverage Analysis**:
- Functional Scope & Behavior: Clear
- Domain & Data Model: Clear
- Interaction & UX Flow: Clear
- Non-Functional Quality Attributes: N/A (static educational content)
- Integration & External Dependencies: Clear
- Edge Cases & Failure Handling: Clear
- Constraints & Tradeoffs: Clear
- Terminology & Consistency: Clear
- Completion Signals: Clear

**Result**: No critical ambiguities detected. Specification is comprehensive and ready for planning phase.

**Rationale**: All categories are either Clear or Not Applicable. Remaining details (sensor coverage depth, code example complexity, diagram specifics) are implementation decisions better addressed during planning phase rather than specification clarification.

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/sp.plan` to create implementation plan.
