## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created comprehensive specification for Module 2: Digital Twins - Simulation & Sensors. Generated spec.md with complete feature definition:

**Specification Structure**:
- Feature Branch: `004-digital-twins-simulation`
- 5 User Stories with priorities (P1, P1, P1, P2, P2)
- 17 Functional Requirements covering digital twins, simulation, sensors, and navigation
- 10 Success Criteria (all measurable and technology-agnostic)
- 5 Key Entities (Digital Twin, Simulation Environment, Sensor Model, Sensor Data, Physics Engine)
- Clear dependencies on Module 1 (ROS 2)
- Comprehensive edge cases and assumptions

**User Stories**:
1. **P1**: Understand Digital Twins Concept - Foundational knowledge
2. **P1**: Learn Simulation Fundamentals - Critical for understanding digital twins
3. **P1**: Understand Sensor Integration and Data Flow - Connects to Module 1 (ROS 2)
4. **P2**: Apply Digital Twins to Humanoid Robotics Development - Practical applications
5. **P2**: Navigate and Reference Module Content - Enhanced learning experience

**Key Features**:
- Builds on Module 1 (ROS 2) knowledge with clear cross-references
- Maintains consistency with Module 1 structure and Python code examples
- All requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all decisions made with informed defaults
- Comprehensive quality checklist created and validated

**Quality Validation**: All checklist items pass. Specification is ready for `/sp.plan` or `/sp.clarify`.
