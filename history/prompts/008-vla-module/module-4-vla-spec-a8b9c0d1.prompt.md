/sp.specify Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Focus: The convergence of LLMs and Robotics.	

Voice-to-Action: Using OpenAI Whisper for voice commands.

Cognitive Planning: Using LLMs to translate natural language ("Clean the room") into a sequence of ROS 2 actions.

Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid. A final project where a simulated robot receives a voice command, plans a path, navigates obstacles, identifies an object using computer vision, and manipulates it.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created comprehensive feature specification for Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA). Generated complete spec following template structure.

**Specification Structure**:
- **Feature Branch**: `008-vla-module`
- **User Stories**: 6 user stories (4 P1, 2 P2) covering LLM-robotics convergence, voice-to-action, cognitive planning, capstone project, module integration, and navigation
- **Functional Requirements**: 25 requirements covering all aspects of the module
- **Success Criteria**: 15 measurable outcomes focused on student learning
- **Key Entities**: 6 entities (Voice Command, Cognitive Plan, Action Sequence, VLA Pipeline, Capstone Project Scenario, Natural Language Intent)
- **Edge Cases**: 12 edge cases identified covering error scenarios and boundary conditions
- **Dependencies**: Modules 1, 2, and 3 prerequisites documented
- **Out of Scope**: Installation guides, API documentation, advanced algorithm details excluded

**Key Features**:
- Focus on conceptual understanding of VLA systems (LLM-robotics convergence, voice-to-action, cognitive planning)
- Comprehensive capstone project integrating all VLA concepts
- Integration with previous modules (ROS 2, simulation, perception)
- Technology-agnostic success criteria focused on student learning outcomes
- Clear separation between conceptual understanding and implementation details

**Quality Checklist**: All items validated and passing. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. Specification ready for `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`.

**Generated Files**:
- `specs/008-vla-module/spec.md` - Complete specification
- `specs/008-vla-module/checklists/requirements.md` - Quality validation checklist

Specification complete and ready for planning phase.
