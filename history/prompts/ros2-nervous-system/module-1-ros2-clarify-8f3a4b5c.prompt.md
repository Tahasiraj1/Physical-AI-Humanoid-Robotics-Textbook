## RESPONSE_TEXT

Completed clarification session for Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) specification. Asked and resolved 3 clarification questions:

1. **Prerequisite Knowledge**: Clarified that students must have Python programming knowledge (required prerequisite)
2. **Code Examples Language**: Specified that all code examples will use Python exclusively
3. **Practical Setup Coverage**: Determined module will be conceptual with brief setup overview (workspace structure and basic concepts, but no detailed installation steps)

All clarifications integrated into spec file at `specs/2-ros2-nervous-system/spec.md`. Updated sections: Clarifications, Functional Requirements (FR-001, FR-007), Assumptions, Out of Scope.

Specification is now ready for `/sp.plan` with reduced ambiguity and clear implementation guidance.
