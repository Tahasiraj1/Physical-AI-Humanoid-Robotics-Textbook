Generated comprehensive implementation tasks for Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) content authoring. Created tasks.md with 86 tasks organized by user story priorities:

**Task Organization**:
- Phase 1: Setup (5 tasks) - Module structure and Docusaurus integration
- Phase 2: Foundational (5 tasks) - Content structure standards and templates
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - Learn ROS 2 Fundamentals (14 tasks) - P1, MVP scope
- Phase 4: User Story 2 - Understand Communication Patterns (12 tasks) - P1
- Phase 5: User Story 3 - Apply to Humanoid Robotics (10 tasks) - P2
- Phase 6: User Story 4 - Navigate and Reference (8 tasks) - P2
- Phase 7: Additional Sections (4 tasks) - Workspace overview
- Phase 8: Visual Aids (6 tasks) - Diagrams and illustrations
- Phase 9: Quality Assurance (14 tasks) - Requirements validation
- Phase 10: Integration (8 tasks) - Docusaurus and embedding preparation

**Key Features**:
- All tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- Tasks organized by user story for independent implementation
- Parallel opportunities identified (code examples, visual aids)
- MVP scope defined (User Story 1: 24 tasks)
- Dependencies and story completion order documented
- Each user story phase independently testable

Tasks ready for immediate execution with clear file paths and dependencies.
