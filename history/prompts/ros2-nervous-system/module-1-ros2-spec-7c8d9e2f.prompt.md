## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created feature specification for Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) (feature branch: `2-ros2-nervous-system`). Specification includes:

**User Stories** (4 prioritized):
1. P1: Learn ROS 2 Fundamentals - Core concepts and role as robotic nervous system
2. P1: Understand ROS 2 Communication Patterns - Topics, services, and actions
3. P2: Apply ROS 2 Concepts to Humanoid Robotics Context - Practical applications
4. P2: Navigate and Reference Module Content - Content discoverability and navigation

**Functional Requirements**: 15 requirements covering content coverage, learning objectives, structure, navigation, and RAG integration.

**Success Criteria**: 10 measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes including comprehension metrics, reading time, and RAG retrieval accuracy.

**Key Entities**: Module Section, Learning Objective, Concept, Example/Use Case, Cross-Reference.

**Validation**: All quality checklist items pass. Specification is ready for `/sp.plan` or `/sp.clarify`.
