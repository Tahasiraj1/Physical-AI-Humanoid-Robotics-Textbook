## RESPONSE_TEXT

Performed comprehensive cross-artifact consistency and quality analysis across spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md for Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2).

**Analysis Results**:
- **Coverage**: 96% (24/25 requirements have tasks; SC-006 student feedback missing)
- **Critical Issues**: 0
- **Constitution Violations**: 0
- **Ambiguity Count**: 2 (low severity)
- **Duplication Count**: 0

**Key Findings**:
1. All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-015) have task coverage
2. All success criteria except SC-006 have corresponding tasks
3. Constitution principles properly aligned across all artifacts
4. Minor gaps: Student feedback mechanism (SC-006), edge case addressing tasks
5. Minor ambiguities: FR-009 language clarity, SC-010 complex concepts definition

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION - No blocking issues detected. Minor enhancements can be addressed during implementation or as follow-up improvements.
