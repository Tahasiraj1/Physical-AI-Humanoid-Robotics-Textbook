## PROMPT_TEXT

```text
I'm building a book on Physical AI, Humanoid, Robotics. We'd have to use docusaurous, with github pages  for deployment.

- This book will consist of several modules (i.e chapters).

- We'll than build an RAG chatkit, using Qdrant vector database, and a chatkit for frontend.

- We'll embed the book's content, in our vector database.

- We'll build an AI Agent using OpenAI Agents SDK connected to our database for querying, and expose it via Fastapi, for frontend to call upon.

- We'll deploy our Agent on Hugging Face Space via docker image.
```

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created initial project constitution (v1.0.0) for Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Textbook project. Established six core principles:

1. **Documentation-First Architecture**: Docusaurus-based modular content structure
2. **Modular Content Organization**: Discrete chapters with clear boundaries
3. **Vector Database Integration**: Qdrant embedding requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
4. **AI Agent Architecture**: OpenAI Agents SDK with FastAPI backend
5. **Deployment Standards**: GitHub Pages (book) and Hugging Face Space (agent)
6. **API-First Backend Design**: FastAPI RESTful endpoints

Added Technology Stack Requirements and Development Workflow sections. Constitution establishes governance framework with version 1.0.0, ratified 2025-12-01.
